# Elasticsearch Embeddings for Hybrid Search and Recommendations

This project aims to build a hybrid search and recommendation system using Elasticsearch and machine learning embeddings. It focuses on enhancing search functionality by combining traditional keyword-based search with AI-powered semantic search. The goal is to create a more accurate and relevant search experience, particularly for large content bases such as VA.gov, by integrating embeddings into Elasticsearch.

## Key Features:
Hybrid search combining Elasticsearch's powerful keyword search with AI embeddings for semantic understanding
Recommendations based on search history, content relevancy, and user preferences
Scalable and customizable to handle large datasets

## Technologies Used:
Elasticsearch
Machine learning embeddings
Python for model training and integration
Next.js for the frontend

This project is intended to provide an open-source solution for hybrid search and recommendation systems, with potential applications in government websites, e-commerce, and content-heavy platforms.
